This repository includes a brief summary of interesting books, articles and my own notes to develop skills required to pursue career in data science.

``So, what is a data scientist?``  

Here are some answers from
[Kaggle](https://gigaom.com/2013/07/11/kaggle-now-has-100k-data-scientists-but-whats-a-data-scientist/), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science),     
and datascience@berkeley - [Data science Life cycle](https://datascience.berkeley.edu/about/what-is-data-science/).

>“The ability to take data — to be able to **understand it**, to **process it**, to **extract value from it**, to **visualize it**, to **communicate it** — that’s going to be a hugely important skill in the next decades.”  
 --- Hal Varian, chief economist at Google and UC Berkeley professor of information sciences, business, and economics 3

*Fig 1. Data science life cycle[1][]:*  

The image represents the five stages of the data science life cycle:   
1. Capture   
2. Maintain
3. Process
4. Analyze
5. Communicate

To summarize,
* you need be skilled at the tools and techniques to manage and manipulate with data (stage 1 and 2),
* and proficient in programming language to efficiently implement the machine learning algorithms to do tasks like clustering, classification, regression, and ect.(stage 3 and 4),
* domain knowledge to make practical and physical sense of data product.

**Machine learning** comes into play at the stage 3 and 4 of data processing and analyzing. If you want to dig into machine learning a bit here, this article - [Understanding a Machine Learning workflow through food](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-a-machine-learning-workflow-through-food-690ddad7803)- explains the workflow of machine learn through cooking.

``And what does it take to became a data scientist?``

[This blog](https://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/a-practical-introduction-to-data-science-from-zipfian-academy) on datasciencecentral.com gives a great practical introduction to data science, specially, the critical and basic skills and knowledge needed.  

I also find this amazing pragmatic and visual representation of a curriculum, a learning plan that one can use in this becoming a data scientist journey by Swami Chandrasekaran.

**The skill sets required to be a data scientist:**

*1. Manipulate with *BIG* data*
* Data acquisition
   - web scraping...
   - API...
* Data ingestion
   - dataset management (SQL ...)
   ...
* Data integration
   - serialization
* Data wrangling and munging  
   - working with data in CPU (numpy, pandas ...)
   - data preprocessing (cleaning, missing data)
   - visualization
   - feature extraction
   ...
