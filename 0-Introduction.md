The topics will be discussed are listed as following. I am trying to develop a throughout understanding all the learn machine learning algorithms by digging into the associated mathematics concepts. So, I'll go through important mathematics for ML and then I will always start with the mathematic behind when discussing the ML algorithms.

#### 1. Statistics and ML
1. Statistical learning and machine Learning
2. Statistical inference
3. Frequentist statistics    
    * central limit theorem
    * Law of large number
    * Parametric and nonparametric method
4. Bayesian statistics
5. Bayesian statistics and frequentist statistics
6. Distributions


#### 2. Linear algebra and ML

#### 3. Calculus and ML
#### 3. Machine learning algorithms
1. Supervised Learning
 * Linear **regression** and linear **classification**
 * From linear to non-linear (LR to NN)
2. Deep learning
